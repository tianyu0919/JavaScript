[00:00.000]They say that life is always easier
[00:04.119]After you let yourself come undone
[00:10.034]They say they'll give you whatever you want
[00:14.451]And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[00:18.961]Seizing time where no one's been before
[00:22.662]Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
[00:26.379]And I'll be keeping secrets
[00:30.462]Till I'm in the ground
[00:36.129]Keep your past your own, I don't care about before
[00:40.546]I don't wanna know your secrets, I wanna help you keep yours
[00:44.473]No one needs to, no one'll ever know what we do
[00:48.240]Where we go, why don't we go to a place where only we know?
[00:51.924]Where we escape from real life and it feels good and it feels nice
[00:55.774]That we ain't yet but we still might
[00:57.388]Cause we go with it if it feels right
[00:59.255]And it feels... feels amazing
[01:02.888]We ain't ready to see the day And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[01:07.772]Seizing time where no one's been before
[01:10.856]Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
[01:14.889]And I'll be keeping secrets
[01:18.773]And I'll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[01:22.852]Seizing time where no one's been before
[01:26.502]Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
[01:30.185]And I'll be keeping secrets
[01:34.335]Till I'm in the ground
[01:36.519]Let go of fear
[01:37.999]This can be a secret that we both keep, that we both share
[01:41.216]Keep it behind the smiles we both wear
[01:43.049]As the sun creeps through the curtains
[01:45.600]On the walls we become two silhouettes
[01:47.333]As we close our eyes
[01:49.250]Let go of the lies that fill our heads
[01:51.100]Let's light it up, live life in the moment
[01:54.667]Why would we worry about where we might end up?
[01:56.884]They can't see us, they can't judge us, it's just us
[02:00.301]They might wonder but only we know where we go when the sun comes up
[02:04.116]And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[02:07.617]Seizing time where no one's been before
[02:11.017]Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
[02:14.833]And I'll be keeping secrets
[02:18.834]And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[02:22.000]Seizing time where no one's been before
[02:25.649]Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
[02:29.366]And I'll be keeping secrets
[02:33.283]Till I'm in the ground
[02:35.326]I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the sun
[02:38.980]Where I belong there's something coming on
[02:43.268]I'm in the shadow of, the shadow of the sun
[02:47.151]Oh, and I need you
[02:50.905]Chasing it, chasing it
[02:52.855]I don't know what I'm chasing is
[02:54.838]All I know is I've been craving it
[02:56.656]Ever since I had a taste of it
[02:58.540]Life is what you make of it
[03:00.374]We're just here writing our own books
[03:02.074]This is just a page of it
[03:03.941]Before you wave your fingers at us
[03:05.774]You better make sure your hands are clean
[03:07.907]We all obey, our hands are tied
[03:09.680]And I don't wanna have to leave
[03:11.647]I don't wanna say goodbye
[03:13.730]They say life is always easier when you come undone
[03:17.580]When I go, you'll know where I've gone
[03:19.371]And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[03:35.615]And I’ll be waiting in the shadow of the sun
[03:38.998]Seizing time where no one's been before
[03:42.565]Close the curtains, what you waiting for?
[03:46.248]And I'll be keeping secrets
[03:50.365]Till I'm in the ground`;
